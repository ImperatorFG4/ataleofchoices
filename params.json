Arnold and the others E3 MAP modders.\r\n\r\n    Installation\r\n\r\n1) If you have an older version of the mod installed, delete those older versions first. \r\n\r\n2) Unzip to your Darkest Hour mod folder inside the game folder. \r\n\r\n3) Make sure the mod was extracted to the correct folder. Inside the 'mod' folder, there should be at least a Darkest Hour FULL and LIGHT folders. If there is not, you extracted the mod incorrectly. \r\n\r\n4) Unzip any Hotfixes to your Darkest Hour folder (same place you installed the mod in step 2).\r\n\r\n5) Start the Darkest Hour launcher and select 'Darkest Hour TOC' in the list of mods. \r\n\r\n6) Uncheck 'Play Intro' and 'Unit Sprites' \r\n\r\n7) Hit Launch.\r\n\r\n    Disclaimer\r\n\r\nA Tale of Choices is a collaborative effort. While most of the work is done by me personally, it also includes parts of many other mods (see credits for full list). You are free to use any part of this mod in your own mods as long as you give due credit to the creator of said part.\r\n\r\n    Features\r\n\r\n    *To be added* \r\n\r\n    Optional Modules\r\n\r\n    *To be added*\r\n\r\n    FAQ\r\n\r\n    *To be added*",
